## Smart Contract 
Smart contract adds a layer of logic and computation to the trust infrastructure supported by the blockchain. 
This allow for execution of code, enhancing the basic value transfer capability of the Bitcoin Blockchain. 
In smart contracts encrypted transaction logs are exchanged among participants.

## Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)
EVM is a special structure where code (smart contracts written in Solidity - a high level programming language) is deployed on after being translated into byte-code. 
The role of the EVM is to deploy a number of extra functionalities to the Blockchain and allow Ethereum nodes to maintain consensus across the blockchain.
